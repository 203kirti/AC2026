Task 1️⃣ : [Decreasing Sequence](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/decreasing-sequence2722/1)
ISSUE :
Time complexity.
N = 4, K = 5
A[] = {1, 1, 2, 3}
Output:
3
Explanation:
One operation is required to change a[2] = 2
into -3 and two opertations are required to
change a[3] = 3 into -7. The resulting
sequence will be 1 1 -3 -7. Hence, in
total 3 operations are required.
